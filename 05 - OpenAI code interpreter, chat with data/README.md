# Data Analysis with PDF and CSV Data Sources

This project demonstrates two key tasks:

1. Implementing a chatbot to interact with data extracted from a PDF document with 100+ pages.
2. Using a CSV datasource with 1000+ rows to build a histogram and analyze hypotheses.

## Task 1: Chatbot with PDF Data

### Datasource
- ["The Great Gatsby" by F. Scott Fitzgerald](https://adapted-english-books.site/books/4/Francis_Scott_Fitzgerald-The_Great_Gatsby.pdf) (PDF with 100+ pages).

### Prompt Used
> Use the PDF document of *The Great Gatsby* to answer questions about the plot, characters, and themes.
