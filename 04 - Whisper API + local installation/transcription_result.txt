Speaker 1:
API. And this is very, let me show the slides. So here, here are the slides for today. So what is the Whisper? And why are we discussing that? So mostly when people discuss the generative AI or AI in general, so they focus on like LLMs, AI pilots, functions, and stuff like that.
So everything that works with text, right? Because it has more application to the business when you work with text, but still, usually what is being forgotten is images and audio processing. And regarding the images, I can't say this, like, easier to monetize, so not too much business applications.
So I know a lot of cases where clients came to us, like EPAM, and asked to create something. Like, I don't know, maybe a read of over 100 of cases. And only several of them were related to image generation, but some of them, like more of these cases, are related to audio. And one of the usual requests is, okay guys, we have 5,000 hours of recordings of, I don't know, meetings or customers calling us for support. So we need to understand this data.
Right? So imagine you have first-line support, like people calling, like real users calling, describing the issue, and the operators are just sharing. So what should you do to solve it? And you need to control it somehow, right? So you need to see what are the most popular questions, so what are the answers, so is the client happy or not?
And for this case, you need to voice processing. And processing the voice is actually very old technology. I don't remember how old it is, but two things here usually work: text-to-speech and speech-to-text. And if we check, I don't know, like, let's check Azure text-to-speech.
Okay, it's AI speech now. All right, I got it. Everything is AI now. Let me check the pricing, actually. DTS pricing. It's super cheap, it's super cheap. Okay, I think here. So this is, okay, free tier, all right. Basically, all right, delete this one.
So speech-to-text. So in order to transcribe something, like if you have a phone call, real-time transcription, $1 per hour, that's too much. Okay, batch transcription. So if I have a lot of audio calls, I don't know, like 100, I can post them as a batch. And this will result in 80 cents per hour, so not too much, actually. Yeah, as usual, Microsoft has very complicated billing, so it's hard to understand how much you will spend. Yeah, and here is the text-to-speech.
So basically, two directions: from speech, you can extract text, and from text, you can generate speech, right? And this is like the standard voice. I think this standard voice became neural during the last year because previously they had a different pricing. The standard voice is like this robotized voice you usually hear when you call a bank or something, and neural voice is more pleasant, more realistically, more naturally toned.
So right now, I don't think they should have some kind of cheap voice, like this old cheap voice. Probably it's inside the Azure AI studio, but the check is not expensive, right? So 1 million characters is like, it's a lot. $15 for business, it's like, well, not too much, I think. And in case we have 1,000 phone calls transcribed, so it will result in only less than $200. So that's acceptable for that. And they definitely use machine learning there, right? So because there's no way programmatically to be able to do that.
