It’s quite an interesting question, actually. I didn’t fully understand how quantum computers work on a general level until recently. I’ve been studying quantum physics for at least one or two years at university, but there’s still a lot to process. Many electronic devices operate based on quantum effects. For example, some systems rely on the phenomenon where electrons can "tunnel" through barriers they typically can’t overcome. It seems almost magical, but it’s how things like TVs and smartphones work. The exact mechanism behind it isn’t entirely clear, but it works.

When it comes to quantum computers, I find the concept of something being both 0 and 1 simultaneously hard to grasp. It’s one of those things you can imagine, but it’s still tricky to understand fully. And then there’s the issue of storage. In classical storage systems like HDDs or SSDs, you need to be able to write data and read it in the future. So, with quantum computing, how is that going to work?

Another concern I’ve heard from the community is regarding the potential of quantum computers. They’re expected to be much more powerful than classical computers, capable of performing millions of computations per second. What happens to encryption algorithms in this case, like RSA? Modern encryption relies on what’s known as a one-way function in mathematics. The idea is that it’s easy to multiply two prime numbers together to get a result, but it’s nearly impossible to figure out the prime numbers if you’re only given the result. This is the foundation of a lot of encryption, and the question is, what happens when quantum computers can break it?
